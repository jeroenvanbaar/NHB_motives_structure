# Latent motives guide structure learning during adaptive social choice

Data & code for the forthcoming paper <i>Latent motives guide structure learning during adaptive social choice</i> by Van Baar, Nassar, Deng, & FeldmanHall (in press, Nature Human Behavior). DOI: 10.1038/s41562-021-01207-4

There are four studies in the paper, each of which has its own folder in this repo. For modeling code check out study 1; the same code was used for model analyses in the other studies. The code is probably not 100% plug and play, because you may have to change paths, install missing packages etc. But with a bit of tinkering it should work :) enjoy!
